Ideas
- Return early after finding the last N releases so it doesn't continue iterating deployments
- Could rewrite many operations using LINQ instead
- Cater for failed deployments (maybe exclude these)
- Restrict retrieval of recent releases to a date range so releases from inactive projects aren't returned
- Allow for different N configurations per project/environment (e.g. maybe keep less releases for dev/staging)
- Extend to cater for release packages

TODO
- Extend unit testing
